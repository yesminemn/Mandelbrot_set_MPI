Parallelized the computation by dividing the workload among multiple processes running on different nodes. Used a master-slave architecture, where the master process distributed tasks to the slave processes and collected the results.

Used OpenMPI as the MPI implementation. The system had three nodes, with two cores each, running Ubuntu 20.04. set up the communication by configuring ssh and nfs server.
